            { question: "What is DNA?", answer: "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information." },
            { question: "What is the difference between DNA and RNA?", answer: "DNA stores genetic information, while RNA helps in the process of making proteins." },
            { question: "What is mitosis?", answer: "Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells." },
            { question: "What is meiosis?", answer: "Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces four non-identical gametes (sperm and egg cells)." },
            { question: "What is the purpose of the ribosome?", answer: "Ribosomes are responsible for assembling proteins in the cell." },
            { question: "What is the function of the mitochondria?", answer: "Mitochondria produce energy (ATP) for the cell through cellular respiration." },
            { question: "What is the function of the chloroplast?", answer: "Chloroplasts conduct photosynthesis in plant cells, converting light energy into chemical energy." },
            { question: "What is a gene?", answer: "A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait or protein." },
            { question: "What is an allele?", answer: "An allele is a version of a gene that can determine a specific trait." },
            { question: "What is a dominant allele?", answer: "A dominant allele is one that will express its trait even if only one copy is present." },
            { question: "What is a recessive allele?", answer: "A recessive allele will only express its trait if two copies are present (one from each parent)." },
            { question: "What is the difference between genotype and phenotype?", answer: "Genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism, while phenotype is the physical appearance or traits." },
            { question: "What is genetic variation?", answer: "Genetic variation refers to the differences in DNA sequences among individuals in a population." },
            { question: "What is natural selection?", answer: "Natural selection is the process where organisms with traits that help them survive and reproduce are more likely to pass those traits on to the next generation." },
            { question: "What is evolution?", answer: "Evolution is the change in the genetic makeup of a population over time." },
            { question: "What is the role of the cell cycle?", answer: "The cell cycle is the process through which a cell grows, divides, and prepares for the next cycle." },
            { question: "What is the function of the nucleus?", answer: "The nucleus stores the cellâ€™s genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities." },
            { question: "What is a mutation?", answer: "A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence that can lead to changes in traits or behaviors." },
            { question: "What are the four major biomolecules?", answer: "The four major biomolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids." },
            { question: "What is the function of carbohydrates?", answer: "Carbohydrates provide energy and are a key part of cell structure." },
            { question: "What are lipids?", answer: "Lipids are fats that store energy, protect organs, and make up cell membranes." },
            { question: "What is the function of proteins?", answer: "Proteins serve many functions, including catalyzing reactions, supporting cell structure, and transporting materials." },
            { question: "What are nucleic acids?", answer: "Nucleic acids, like DNA and RNA, store and transmit genetic information." },
            { question: "What is the role of water in biology?", answer: "Water is essential for life because it helps with chemical reactions, temperature regulation, and nutrient transport." },
            { question: "What is a food chain?", answer: "A food chain shows how energy flows from one organism to another in an ecosystem." },
            { question: "What is a food web?", answer: "A food web is a network of interconnected food chains that shows the complex feeding relationships in an ecosystem." },
            { question: "What is the role of producers in an ecosystem?", answer: "Producers, like plants, make their own food through photosynthesis and provide energy for other organisms in the ecosystem." },
            { question: "What is a trophic level?", answer: "A trophic level represents a position in the food chain or food web, such as producer, primary consumer, or secondary consumer." },
            { question: "What is the difference between an autotroph and a heterotroph?", answer: "Autotrophs make their own food (like plants), while heterotrophs rely on other organisms for food (like animals)." },
            { question: "What is an ecosystem?", answer: "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their environment." },
            { question: "What is biodiversity?", answer: "Biodiversity refers to the variety of different species in an ecosystem." },
            { question: "What is the water cycle?", answer: "The water cycle describes how water moves through the environment, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection." },
            { question: "What is ecological succession?", answer: "Ecological succession is the process by which ecosystems change over time, with one community gradually being replaced by another." },
            { question: "What is the difference between primary and secondary succession?", answer: "Primary succession happens in an area where no life existed before, while secondary succession occurs in an area where a disturbance has taken place but some life remains." },
            { question: "What are the stages of the cell cycle?", answer: "The cell cycle includes interphase (growth), mitosis (cell division), and cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm)." },
            { question: "What is the function of the Golgi apparatus?", answer: "The Golgi apparatus processes and packages proteins and lipids for transport out of the cell." },
